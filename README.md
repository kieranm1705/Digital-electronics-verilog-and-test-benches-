# Digital-electronics-verilog-and-test-benches-

This repository contains Verilog implementations and testbenches for a series of digital logic components designed as part of the 6E5Z0003 Digital Electronics project.

## Components Included
- **2-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX2)**
- **4-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX4)**
- **Full Adder**
- **1-Bit ALU**
- **4-Bit ALU**
- **Register File (16x8)**

Each component is accompanied by:
- Verilog source code
- Testbench code
- Simulation waveforms
- Block schematic diagrams

## Project Description
The aim of this project was to design, implement, and simulate a functional 4-bit ALU with supporting modules. The designs were tested using waveform simulations to verify correct functionality.

The final report includes:
- Truth tables for each design
- Schematic diagrams
- Simulation results
- Evaluation of performance and possible improvements
